git-scripts
===========

A bunch of scripts to save you some time for git and github operations if you are new to git and github operations. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04.

init_github.sh - generate ssh keys and provide instructions for github account settings. test whether the setup is succesfull after all done. See usage inside the script.

git_config.sh - some global configurations for local environment..emails and name sigiture...and it will cache your github passwords and you don't need to reinput for 90 days. Also include some convinient aliases. 

git.sh - wraps up and down operations to forked repos and upstream repos. new/delete branch and setup(clone and some initializations) operations.
